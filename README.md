Intro-to-WSL-Ubuntu
WSL lets you use the tools you want, in the environment you want, on the hardware you want.

Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer or just getting started, one of the most important decisions

you need to make is the type of hardware and development environment to use. In the past, most dev 
professionals would have told you to stick with macOS or Linux because the most common development tools, 
languages, and frameworks were easy to install and work with. All that has changed with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 
WSL lets you run a GNU/Linux environment - including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications - directly on Windows, 
unmodified and fully integrated with your Windows file system and favorite tools like Visual Studio Code.

Want to work with Node.js? Ruby on Rails? Django and Python? With WSL, you can install your preferred Linux distribution (like Ubuntu), 
and when you open it for the first time you'll be greeted by a familiar face: the Bash shell. From there, you can treat it like a 
regular Linux distribution: install binaries by using the package manager, edit files in built-in editors like Vim or Emacs, 
and start processes as true Linux binaries.

Even better, you can now directly access Windows files and tools from the Bash shell and seamlessly move between your Linux 
and Windows environment. You don't need to choose between Bash and PowerShell. You can use them both.
